## 👋 Hi, I'm Luca!
I'm a self-taught developer with 5 years of hands-on experience in software development. My journey started out of sheer curiosity and has grown into a passion for building efficient and visually appealing web applications, starting on **C#**, going going through **Python** and the last year focusing mainly on **JavaScript**.

### Main Tools and Technologies:

- **🖼 Frontend:** React, Angular, Next.js, JS, HTML.
- **📱 Mobile:** React Native, Kotlin.
- **🗄 Backend:** Express, Socket.IO, Next.js, .NET.
- **🎨 Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, MaterialUI and other libraries.
- **⚙️ Embedded system:** C & C++

🔎 I'm constantly exploring new technologies and improving my skills. My goal is to create useful applications with an accessible UI and I'm eager to work on projects to professionalize my skills!
